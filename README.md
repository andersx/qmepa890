# qmepa890
QM calculated proton affinities (e\_{pa}) of 890 molecules from the QM7 database

Licensed under the terms of the CC0 1.0 license.

The CSV file contains the following information

1: File ID (e.g. 0415 means the information pertains to the files 0415.xyz and 0415\_+.xyz)
2: Index of the proton (in the XXXX\_+.xyz file)
3: Gas-phase energy of neutral molecule plus thermal corrections from vibrational analysis
4: Gas-phase energy of protonated molecule plus thermal corrections from vibrational analysis
5: Gas-phase energy of neutral molecule
6: Gas-phase energy of protonated molecule
7: Energy of neutral molecule using SMD implicit solvent model
8: Energy of protonated molecule using SMD implicit solvent model

All structures are optimized at the PBE0/def2-TZVP level of theory, and all energies are calculated at this level as well. No RI etc approximations were used. Structures are verified to not have structural rearrangements after optimization (e.g. rotation of groups etc.)

Cheers.
